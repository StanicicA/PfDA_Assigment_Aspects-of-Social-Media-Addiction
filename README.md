## Data Set Information:
Images of Kecimen and Besni raisin varieties grown in Turkey were obtained with CVS. 
A total of 900 raisin grains were used, including 450 pieces from both varieties. 
These images were subjected to various stages of pre-processing and 7 morphological features were extracted.

## Attribute Information:
1.) 'Area': *Gives the number of pixels within the boundaries of the raisin.*
2.) 'Perimeter': *It measures the environment by calculating the distance between the boundaries of the raisin and the pixels around it.*
3.) 'MajorAxisLength': *Gives the length of the main axis, which is the longest line that can be drawn on the raisin.*
4.) 'MinorAxisLength': *Gives the length of the small axis, which is the shortest line that can be drawn on the raisin.*
5.) 'Eccentricity': *It gives a measure of the eccentricity of the ellipse, which has the same moments as raisins.*
6.) 'ConvexArea': *Gives the number of pixels of the smallest convex shell of the region formed by the raisin.*
7.) 'Extent': *Gives the ratio of the region formed by the raisin to the total pixels in the bounding box.*
8.) 'Class': *Kecimen and Besni raisin.*

In this study variables were tested and various methods were used in order to distinguish between two different variety of raisins.('Kecimen and Besni') grown in Turkey. Firstly, a total of 900 pieces raisin grains were obtained, from an equal number of both varieties. These images were subjected to various preprocessing steps and 7 morphological feature extraction operations were performed using image processing techniques. In addition, minimum, mean, maximum and standard deviation statistical information was calculated for each Class. The distributions of both raisin varieties on the features were examined and these distributions were shown on the graphs.
